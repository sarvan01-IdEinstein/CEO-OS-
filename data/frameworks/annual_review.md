# The Annual Review Framework
*Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin (@dranthonygustin).*

**Purpose**: To perform a deep-dive autopsy of the previous year and thoughtfully architect the next one. This is not about setting arbitrary resolutions; it is about aligning your life with your reality.

## Core Concept: Energy Management
The fundamental metric of this review is **Energy**, not simple productivity.
- **Energy Givers**: Things, people, and tasks that leave you feeling alive, excited, and capable.
- **Energy Drainers**: Things, people, and tasks that leave you feeling depleted, resentful, or tired.

## How to execute this review

### Step 1: The Calendar Audit
Go through every single week of your calendar from the past year. Yes, every week.
- **List your top 20% wins**: What went famously well?
- **List your top 20% losses**: What went wrong?
- **Identify People**: Who did you spend time with? Did they give or drain energy?
- **Identify Activities**: What work tasks did you do? Did they give or drain energy?

### Step 2: The 80/20 Analysis (Pareto Principle)
- Look at your lists.
- **Goal for Next Year**: eliminating the bottom 20% of drainers (tasks/people) and doubling down on the top 20% of givers.

### Step 3: Categorization
Review your year across these domains:
1.  **Health** (Physical, Mental)
2.  **Relationships** (Partner, Kids, Friends, Community)
3.  **Work/Mission** (Impact, Team, Growth)
4.  **Finance** (Net worth, Cash flow, Investments)
5.  **Learning/Travel** (Skills, Experiences)

### Step 4: Planning the Next Year
- **Stop**: What will you stop doing? (This is more important than what you start).
- **Start**: What new habit or project will you undertake?
- **Continue**: What is working that you must protect?

*Note: This framework is best used in conjunction with the template in `reviews/annual/template.md`.*
