# The Life Map
*Adapted from Alex Lieberman (@businessbarista).*

**Purpose**: To ensure you are not winning at business while failing at life.

## Core Concept
We often optimize for Career/Money because they change accurately and fast. Other areas (Health, Relationships) lag. The Life Map forces you to view your life as a portfolio of assets, all of which need management.

## The 6 Buckets

### 1. Career/Work
*Your professional contribution, the vehicle for your ambition, and your craft.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]

### 2. Relationships
*Partner, Children, Friends, Family, Network. The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]

### 3. Health
*Physical performance, sleep, nutrition, longevity, mental clarity.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]

### 4. Finances
*Freedom, security, optionality. Not just income, but net worth and burn rate.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]

### 5. Meaning/Spirituality
*Connection to something larger, meditation, philosophy, religion, or simple quietude.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]

### 6. Fun/Play
*Activities done for their own sake, not for an outcome. Hobbies, adventure, joy.*
- Current Satisfaction (1-10): [ ]
- The Goal: [ ]
