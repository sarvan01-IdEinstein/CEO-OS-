# Vivid Vision Framework
*Inspired by Cameron Herold/Tony Robbins style visualization.*

**Purpose**: To create a high-definition mental movie of your future that acts as a subconscious magnet.

## Core Concept
Most goals are vague ("I want to make more money"). A Vivid Vision is crystalline ("It is December 31st, 2027. I am sitting on the deck of my house in..."). When the brain has a clear target, it subconsciously filters for opportunities to hit that target.

## Rules of Engagement
1.  **3 Years Out**: Far enough to dream big, close enough to be real.
2.  **Present Tense**: Write as if it has already happened. "I am," not "I will."
3.  **Sensory Details**: What does your life feel like? What is the pace? What are you reading? Who are you having dinner with?
4.  **No "How"**: Do not worry about how you got there. Focus entirely on the result.

## The Script
*Draft your vision covering these areas:*

### 1. The Feeling
"I wake up feeling..."
"My days feel..."
"My stress levels are..."

### 2. The Business/Career
"My company is known for..."
"My role has shifted to..."
"I am no longer doing..."
"We have achieved..."

### 3. The Personal Life
"I am physically in the best shape of my life, measuring..."
"My relationship with my partner is..."
"I spend my free time..."

### 4. The Impact
"I have helped..."
"I am recognized for..."
