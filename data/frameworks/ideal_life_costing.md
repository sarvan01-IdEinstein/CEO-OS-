# Ideal Lifestyle Costing
*Adapted from Tim Ferriss's "Dreamlining" (The 4-Hour Workweek).*

**Purpose**: To demystify the money required to live your "dream life."

## Core Concept
Most high-performers chase "The Number" (e.g., $10M Net Worth). This is often an arbitrary trap. Instead, we calculate the **Target Monthly Income (TMI)** required to live your ideal lifestyle *right now*. It is usually surprisingly lower than you think.

## The Calculus

### Step 1: Define the Dream
List 3-5 things you would do if you had unlimited money (related to things you *have*, *be*, or *do*).
*Examples: Drive an Aston Martin, Spend a month in Italy, Hire a personal chef.*

### Step 2: Cost the Dream (Monthly)
Research the actual monthly cost of these things. don't guess.
- **Aston Martin Lease**: ~$2,800/mo
- **Airbnb in Florence (1 month spread over 12 months)**: $4,000 / 12 = $333/mo
- **Personal Chef (2x/week)**: ~$800/mo

### Step 3: Add Living Expenses
Add your current immutable burn rate (Mortgage, Insurance, Food, Utilities).
*Example: $12,000/mo*

### Step 4: The Total (TMI)
Add Dream Costs + Living Expenses + buffer (30%).
*Example: $2,800 + $333 + $800 + $12,000 = $15,933/mo.*

### The Insight
In this example, your dream life costs ~$190k/year post-tax. You don't need $10M in the bank to live it; you need cash flow. This shifts the focus from "Accumulation" to "Cash Flow Design."
