# Operating Principles

## 1. Clarity Over Speed
Uncertainty costs more than time. If I am unsure, I stop. I define the problem before I solve it. I define the outcome before I start the work.

## 2. Eliminate, Automate, Delegate, Do
My energy is my most finite resource. I rigorously critique every demand on my time. If it can be removed, it goes. If it can be done by a machine, it is built. If it can be done by someone else, it is handed off with trust. I only do what only I can do.

## 3. Direction Over Speed
Fast in the wrong direction is just lost. I check my compass (Goals/North Star) before I check my speedometer (Task Lists).

## 4. One Thing at a Time
Multitasking is a lie. It is merely rapid context switching, which destroys deep thought. I focus on one strategic objective until it is resolved or structured for others to resolve.

## 5. Ruthless Truth
I cannot manage what I do not acknowledge. I tell myself the truth about my team, my numbers, my performance, and my feelings. This system is a safe harbor for that truth.

## 6. Rest is a Weapon
I do not hustle for the sake of optics. Recovery is part of performance. I protect my sleep and my non-work time as fiercely as I protect my revenue.

## 7. Simple Scales, Complex Fails
I avoid bureaucracy. I avoid "productivity theater." If a process doesn't serve the outcome, I kill it.

## 8. Who, Not How
When faced with a challenge, my first thought is "Who can solve this?" not "How do I solve this?"

## 9. Hell Yes or No
If an opportunity or commitment isn't an immediate "Hell Yes," it is a "No." There is no room for "Maybe."
